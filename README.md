# Cost Efficiency Analysis of Private Hospitals

## Project Overview

This project aims to evaluate the cost efficiency of twelve private hospitals using two different models: the cost efficiency model proposed by Färe et al. (1985) and the cost efficiency model by Tone (2002). Both models will operate under the assumption of constant returns to scale (CRS). By applying these models, we will assess how well each hospital converts its inputs into outputs, considering the costs associated with its operations.

## Problem Description

### Dataset

The dataset includes information on the following metrics for each of the twelve hospitals:

- **Inputs:**
  - Number of Doctors
  - Cost of Doctors
  - Number of Nurses
  - Cost of Nurses

- **Outputs:**
  - Number of Outpatients
  - Number of Inpatients

### Objectives

The project has the following objectives:

1. **Measure Cost Efficiency using Färe et al. Model**: Implement the cost efficiency model by Färe et al. (1985) to compute the cost efficiency scores for the hospitals.
2. **Measure Cost Efficiency using Tone Model**: Apply the cost efficiency model by Tone (2002) to determine the cost efficiency scores for the same hospitals.
3. **Analyze Differences**: Examine and justify any differences observed between the efficiency scores obtained from the two models.

## Methodology

### 1. Färe et al. Cost Efficiency Model

The cost efficiency model by Färe et al. (1985) will be implemented in MATLAB to calculate the efficiency of each hospital based on the input and output data. This model utilizes a linear programming approach to assess efficiency relative to the best-performing units.

### 2. Tone Cost Efficiency Model

The cost efficiency model by Tone (2002) will also be implemented to measure efficiency. This model considers both input and output orientations and provides an alternative perspective on the hospitals' performance.

### 3. Comparison and Analysis

After calculating the efficiency scores from both models, a comparative analysis will be conducted to understand the variations in results. Factors such as differences in assumptions, model formulations, and sensitivity to input/output variations will be explored to provide a comprehensive understanding of the discrepancies.

## Expected Outcomes

The project is expected to yield:

- Cost efficiency scores for each of the twelve private hospitals using both the Färe et al. and Tone models.
- A detailed comparative analysis highlighting the differences in results and potential justifications for those differences.

## Future Enhancements

- **Extended Analysis**: Apply additional models for efficiency assessment, such as the Slack-Based Measure (SBM) or Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) under variable returns to scale.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine how changes in input or output metrics impact efficiency scores.
- **Visualization Tools**: Create visualization tools in MATLAB to graphically represent the efficiency scores and comparisons, enhancing interpretability.

## Conclusion

This project provides a structured approach to measuring and comparing the cost efficiency of private hospitals using established efficiency models. The findings will offer valuable insights into the operational effectiveness of hospitals and guide management decisions aimed at improving resource allocation and service delivery.
